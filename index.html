        <h1>What are Black Holes?</h1>
        <p>
            Mystery, wonder, and curiosity, when it comes to black holes our 
            limited knowledge gives us the gift of curiosity. Speculation of 
            time travel to jumping to distance galaxies, black holes have many
            secrets yet to be discovered to allow us to better understand our
            cosmos.

        <p>
            Black holes are filled with mysteries that we are 
            still uncovering today. The gravity is so great 
            within black holes that light cannot escape, hence 
            the name. Formed from dying stars that get so small 
            and condensed, this matter creates what cannot me 
            seen by human eyes, black holes.

        <h2>Five black hole facts:</h2>
        <img src="img/blackhole-dark.jpg" alt="The dark blackhole">
        <ul>
              <li>Black holes can be large or as tiny as a single atom.</li>
              <li>A tiny black hole can have the mass of a mountain.</li>
              <li>The largest black hole can be 1 million times the suns mass.</li>
              <li>If you fell into a black hole you may never escape.</li>
              <li>Black holes do not pull far objects, the capture close objects.</li>
        </ul>

            One of the most renownded supernova blackholes, SN 1987A, 
            according to human history. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope 
            has begun its research 168,000 lightyears away on this giant 
            situated within the large magellanic cloud. This supernova has 
            been observed with the James Webb telescope for things such as 
            wavelengths, gamma rays, and radio waves for the past 40 years. 
            Since we first layed lenses on this supernova on February of 1987, 
            new developments by Webb's NIRCam (Near Infrared Camera), provides 
            crutial clues on its development and shaping of its remnants over time.
